      <p>Grand Theft Auto Online fans have discovered a possible GTA 6 teaser hidden within the newest trailer for the game’s latest heist.</p>

      <p>It seems like every month or so there is some sort of leak or rumor about the long-awaited GTA 6, but Rockstar has yet to reveal any information on the highly-anticipated, albeit inevitable title.</p>

      <p>instead, the company has gone all-in with GTA Online content and has begun teasing the newest mode known as the Cayo Perico heist.</p>

      <p>One of the teasers for the heist was uploaded to YouTube with the title “surveil.exe.”</p>

      <p>In it, secretive-looking security footage with a green tint shows a body by the beach, with a briefcase and some farmland. Notably, on the bottom of the screen there are some coordinates labeled “38.527A N; 79.6129A W.”</p>

      <p>Most fans would probably just ignore this or chop it up as Rockstar trying to add some neat visual flair to make the footage seem more mysterious.</p>

      <p>However, others decided to do some digging and tried searching for the coordinates on Google Maps. What they ended up seeing was either purposefully intended by Rockstar or one heck of a coincidence. If it’s intentional this would be the first-ever official GTA VI teaser.</p>
