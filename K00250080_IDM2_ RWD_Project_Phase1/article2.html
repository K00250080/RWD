      <p>This page contains the locations and abilities of all known weapons (including one-handed, two-handed, bows and shields) in AC Valhalla.</p>

      <p>Unlike other Assassin's Creed games, weapons in AC Valhalla are very unique, and not many can be found in the world. Each weapon has its own passive ability, and its stats can be upgraded with certain materials. Additionally, weapons can be enhanced with collectible ingots to add rune slots, upgrade their look, and the amount of times they can be upgraded.</p>

      <p>instead, the company has gone all-in with GTA Online content and has begun teasing the newest mode known as the Cayo Perico heist.</p>

      <p>While some weapons can be purchased, many weapons must be found by exploring the yellow points of interest marked Wealth on your map, and may require you to solve some small puzzles to get them.</p>
